# Fundus image classificatoiin with CNN model
### The project involves building a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for cataract classification basedd on fundus image dataset.The dataset includes over 400+ fundus images (a two-dimensional 2D representation of the 3D, semitransparent,retinal tissues projected on to the imaging plane) caterogically grouped into four (4) gorups; 'Normal', 'Cataracts', 'Glaucoma', 'retinal disease'.
### The dataset was acquired from the UCI repository

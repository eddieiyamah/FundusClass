# Fundus image classificatoiin with CNN model
### The project involves building a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for cataract classification basedd on fundus image dataset.The dataset includes over 5000+ fundus images (a two-dimensional 2D representation of the 3D, semitransparent,retinal tissues projected on to the imaging plane) caterogically grouped into four (8) gorups; Normal (N), Diabetes (D), Glaucoma (G), Cataract (C), Age related Macular Degeneration (A), Hypertension (H), Pathological Myopia (M), Other diseases/abnormalities (O).
### The dataset is a structured opthalmic database of fundus images called Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) that represents ‘‘real-life’’ set of patient information collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from different hospitals/medical centers in China.
